## Introduction

The data provides ticket prices for one-way flights found on Expedia. We
sought to find if seatsRemaining and totalTravelDistance affect the
price of a plane ticket (totalFare) and used Multiple Linear Regression
to do this. The original data is a 31GB file of flight tickets found on
Expedia between 04/16/2022 and 10/05/2022.

### Description of Variables

totalFare: The price of the ticket (in USD) including taxes and other
fees.

seatsRemaining: Integer for the number of seats remaining.

totalTravelDistance: The total travel distance in miles.

## Statistical Analysis

We split the large data set into 16 smaller files based on departing
airport and randomly sampled 10% of the data. We used seatsRemaining and
totalTravelDistance as predictors in all our 16 models for basic economy
tickets. The summary table below, Figure 1, shows the results we
achieved from fitting the regression model for ATL airport.

The linear regression model for Atlanta is as follows:
$totalFare = 71.35 + 3.68seatsRemaining + 0.06totalTravelDistance$

For each seat remaining, holding distance constant, the ticket price
will increase by about $\$3.68$. For each 100 miles traveled, holding
seats remaining constant, the ticket price will increase by about $\$6$.
Since the p-value for both coefficients is below $\alpha = 0.05$, we can
conclude that both seatsRemaining and totalTravelDistance affect ticket
price.

The above plots are a couple diagnostic plots before taking the 10%
random sample. As we can see, there are too many observations to get a
good look at the underlying pattern. The below plots are after taking
the 10% sample and unfortunately there are still so many observations
but we did not want to lose the nature of the original data so we
decided not to reduce the random sample further.

A weakness to our analysis is that we aren't taking into consideration a
temporal effect of ticket prices so holidays like Memorial Day, July 4th
and Labor Day are treated the same as other days.

### Comparing the 16 Models

The highest R-squared value of the 16 models is 43.82% and the lowest is
8.73%. These low values of R-squared are most likely due to the temporal
effect limitation discussed above. Nonetheless, both variables,
seatsRemaining and totalTravelDistance, are significant in each model.
This allows us to conclude that our predictors affect ticket price for
all 16 models.

The coefficients for each of the 16 models vary. About half of the
models have a negative relationship between seatsRemaining and
totalFare, whereas the other half is positive. This could be due to an
airline wanting to maximize revenue. For example, if a plane is not at
full capcaity, they could charge more in order to make up for the seats
that are vacant. Each model also has a high intercept.

## Condor Details

We created a shell script to split the large 31GB dataset, filtered by
basic economy tickets, and removed unnecessary columns to reduce memory,
leaving us with 16 files of size 20 to 30 MB. Afterwards, we tested our
R script by running a regression model on only one csv (ATL) to ensure
our scripts were working before running them on all 16 files. We
initially used 1 GB of memory to run our first job but got an error
message stating that more memory was required to run the job.We
increased our memory to 5 GB but that also didn't work. As a result we
had to reduce our focus to only two factors. We realized that lm()
requires a lotof memory to run in CHTC so we ended up increasing our
memory to 8 GB to get just one job to run. Once our first job was
successful, we ran three more jobs and then finally, ran all 16 jobs
which took about 6 minutes to run in total and required 20 GB of memory
along with 2 GB of disk space.

Since linear regression requires a lot of memory to be able to run in
CHTC, it may not be the best option in terms of memory when there are a
hundred jobs to run. It was also hard to view visualizations on CHTC.
The only way to view plots was by transferring the files to our local
machine which can be time consuming when there are multiple jobs to run.

## Conclusion

We wanted to see what factors affected the price of a plane ticket.
Based on our analysis, seatsRemaining and totalTravelDistance
significantly impact the price of a plane ticket regardless of the 16
departing airports we analyzed. For future analysis we could add the
temporal effect of the ticket since we did not look at that aspect for
this analysis.
